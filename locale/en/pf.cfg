quantum-encabulator=The original machine had a baseplate of prefamulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing, such that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fam. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzelvanes so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the 'up' end of the grammeters.\n\nThis one, additionally, is quantum.

planetfall-fulgora-islands-scaling=Scale fulgora islands based on active mods

[mod-setting-description]
planetfall-fulgora-islands-scaling=Makes the default size of islands on Fulgora larger the more PF/BZ mods are installed and the higher the difficulty is. This makes it more comfortable to process everything on a single large island prior to late-game scaling up, even with the multitudes of added intermediates. However you might view coordination of scrapping and crafting dozens of items across multiple islands to be part of the challenge, and also the map generation gets a little silly at large island sizes.\n[color=orange]NOTE: if you turn this on mid playthrough, or change mod configuration, it will result in ugly seams in map generation when exploring new areas on Fulgora.[/color]
