# ABOUT

This is a mod for Factorio blah blah blah write this later. Explain what it does when there are no resource mods.

# DEPENDENCIES

- [pf-functions](https://github.com/ManaFriendsmith/pf-functions) - Library and some misc functionality that does not belong to any one content mod
- [ZZZ-RecyclerFinalFinal](https://github.com/ManaFriendsmith/ZZZ-RecyclerFinalFinal) - Utility to ensure that mods changing an item's recipe also changes what it recycles into. Always required, simply does nothing when quality is not installed.

# SERIES

This mod is not intended to be used on its own (though it can be if you feel like it). It's supposed to be used with one or more of my other mods that add resources and crafting chains.

There are two ways to control the difficulty: a global setting that's part of pf-functions (increases the **depth** of the crafting tree) and adding more mods (increases the **breadth** of the crafting tree). Any combination of these mods should work; please report if there is an error or a softlock.

- [Brass Tacks](https://github.com/ManaFriendsmith/BrassTacks) - Adds zinc and brass. Mechanical parts and galvanized items. Heavily affects Vulcanus, Fulgora.
- [If I Had A Nickel](https://github.com/ManaFriendsmith/IfNickel) - Adds nickel and invar. Motors, valves, rocket engines. Heavily affects Vulcanus, Gleba.
- [Them Thar Hills](https://github.com/ManaFriendsmith/ThemTharHills) - Adds gold. Electronic components. Heavily affects all inner planets.
