This mod contains data and graphics to allow my other resource mods to integrate with Space Age, as well as a handful of balance tweaks. It doesn't do a lot on its own.

Specifically:

- Brassteroids with Brass Tacks. Panspermia asteroids with BrimStuff. Spawn rates of same at all vanilla and some modded space locations. (It's trivial to add support for these, bother me if your favorite planet mod isn't supported.)
- Nerf of asteroid health so the total ammo demand on space platforms is roughly the same with extra asteroids.
- Reconfigures asteroid reprocessing recipes to output all extant asteroid chunk types.
- Philosopher's Hormone with Brass Tacks or If I Had a Nickel (critical to obtaining ores on Gleba).
- Buff space platform thrusters slightly with Brass Tacks and BrimStuff, to compensate for the increased complexity and footprint of ammo/fuel.
- Sinusoidal deplanaration.
- Also everything in the next section.

## But what if I want to use it without your other mods? ##

Uh, okay, sure I guess. It's dependent on pf-functions, which includes a difficulty selection of Minimal, Moderate, and Maximal.

# Rocket control units #

On Moderate and Maximal difficulty, rocket parts and a few space-related buildings now cost RCUs instead of blue circuits. They can be boosted by the electromagnetic plant's intrinsic productivity but not by productivity modules. The base recipe is blue circuits + green circuits + batteries.

There's already a mod for this, but I didn't know about it when I started this project.

When playing with Lunar Landings, that mod's Rocket Control Units used for launching to and from Luna are renamed to Lunar Navigation Units and given a distinct icon.

# Space science nerf #

On Maximal difficulty, space science is less productive so you may want to look into scaling it earlier. It's also needed for all productivity researches.

With most More Materials mods, space science will require additional ingredients. This will require imports from the ground or, once advanced asteroid processing is unlocked, a more complex setup for self-sufficiency.

# Module tweaks #

On all difficulties: efficiency module 2 and 3 are significantly buffed. Quality module 3 is slightly buffed.

On Moderate and Maximal: Level 3 modules must now be crafted on their respective planet. Their recipes have been slightly changed to require more of the unique resources of that planet.

On Maximal: Productivity module 3 is now Aquilo-flavored instead of Nauvis-flavored (it still needs biter eggs.) Biolabs cost Efficiency module 3s. Fusion reactors cost Quality module 3s. Cryogenic plants cost Speed module 3s.

The point of these changes is to encourage more diverse production per planet than a science pack and maybe 1-2 intermediates.

# Free lava #

On Maximal, molten metal from ore recipes now output a small amount of lava. This is what is known as a "purely beneficial nuisance."

# Fulgora softlock prevention #

Fulgoran vault ruins now give a handful of useful buildings (recycler, electric poles, accumulators) when mined. This prevents anything that changes the recipes of these critical entities from bricking the start of Fulgora.

This also gives me license to make it harder. :3

# Fulgora wall-related concussion prevention #

Depending on the number of BZ and Planetfall material mods installed and the difficulty setting, Fulgoran islands will be scaled up. This is to allow a single moderate-to-big island to allow decent and sustainable-without-manual-intervention midgame production of science, intermediates and buildings, without having to fully bot everything or be a Spatial Packing Wizard.

This can be disabled in the mod settings.

# Postgame Logistics Tier #

Adds an extra tier of belts and cargo wagons that can almost keep up with the absurd output of legendary buildings.

This can be disabled in the mod settings.
